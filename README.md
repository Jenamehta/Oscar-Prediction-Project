# Oscar-Prediction-Project
### Objective
In this project I used the publicly available dataset from Thinkful to predict which film will win the oscar award in 2018 using random forest classifier.

### Methodology
The Methodology is based on the concept of Supervised Learning which is a type of machine learning that enables the model to predict future outcomes after they are trained based on past data. This data is used along with SciKit learn, one of the most popular toolkits in the world to obtain our objective

Our approach was applied to Oscar winners and losers over the past 38 years and the model made correct predictions for all years except 1 year which was 2017. After evaluating multiple models with the supervised learning algorithm and importance of features, I determined that random forest classification provided the most accurate prediction of previous Oscar winners.
